# Heading level 1 MusicSearch
### *by Team JFK*

One of the simple joys in life for many people is the experience of getting into a new band or composer. Everybody remembers the first time they heard that special album by their favorite group, and had to know more - what else have these guys recorded? What do they look like? Are there any videos of them? And most critically, are they on Twitter?!

Team JFK's *MusicSearch* aggregates the most commonly sought after data on musicians in one convenient page. Moreover, MusicSearch records and ranks your searches, so information on your top artists is always on hand.
